# Database Backup & Restore Script

A standalone Bash script for backing up and restoring Wine Words databases (local PostgreSQL, Supabase, NeonDB) with full compatibility with the Cloudflare R2 backup format used by GitHub Actions workflows.

## Location

`scripts/db_backup_restore.sh`

## Features

| Command               | Description                                                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `backup`              | Create encrypted backup from local/Supabase/Neon → local filesystem        |
| `restore`             | Restore `.dump` or `.dump.age` to local/Supabase/Neon                      |
| `verify`              | Verify Cloudflare R2 downloaded files (checksum + decryption test)         |
| `list`                | List available backups in Cloudflare R2                                    |
| `restore_r2_to_local` | Download and restore a specific R2 backup (or configured default) to local |
| `download`            | Download specific backup (or `latest`) from R2                             |

## Prerequisites

- **PostgreSQL 18 client** (`pg_dump`, `pg_restore`, `psql`)
- **age** v1.3.2 (encryption tool)
- **awscli** (for R2 operations)
- **jq**, `sha256sum`, `curl`

```bash
# macOS
brew install postgresql@18 age awscli jq

# Verify versions
pg_dump --version    # Should show 18.x
age --version        # Should show 1.3.2
```

## Environment Setup

The `local` provider requires `LOCAL_DATABASE_URL`, read from the exported
environment or `beachvolleyballhub_api/.env.development.local`. Exported values take
precedence. This variable selects the database for local backups and restores;
there is no hard-coded fallback.

### 1. Database URLs (in `.env.development.local`)

```dotenv
# Local PostgreSQL
LOCAL_DATABASE_URL=postgresql:///wine_words_development

# Supabase
SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@db.xxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres

# Neon
NEON_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@ep-xxx.neon.tech/dbname
```

### 2. Encryption and Cloudflare R2 settings

Set these in `wine_words_api/.env.development.local`; no shell exports are needed.
Exported values, when present, take precedence, just as for database URLs. Values
may be unquoted or single/double quoted. An optional `export` prefix is supported. The file is read as data, not executed.

```dotenv
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_RECIPIENT=age1YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_IDENTITY=/absolute/path/to/age-keys.txt
R2_BUCKET=database-backups
R2_ENDPOINT=https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

`BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_IDENTITY` also accepts a raw `AGE-SECRET-KEY-...` value.
Use an identity-file path for an age-keygen document spanning multiple lines.
Generate a new key pair, if needed, with `age-keygen -o age-keys.txt`.
Encryption settings apply to backup, verification, and restore. R2 settings apply
to list and download. Relative identity-file paths are relative to the working
directory from which you run the script.

## Usage Examples

### Backup Local Database

```bash
# Basic backup to ./backups/
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh backup local ./backups

# With custom name
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh backup local ./backups my-dev-backup
```

Output files created:

- `wine-words_postgresql_local_20240115T020000Z.dump` (plaintext, auto-deleted if encrypted)
- `wine-words_postgresql_local_20240115T020000Z.dump.age` (encrypted)
- `wine-words_postgresql_local_20240115T020000Z.dump.sha256` (checksum)
- `wine-words_postgresql_local_20240115T020000Z.dump.json` (metadata)

### Backup Neon/Supabase Database

```bash
# Requires NEON_DATABASE_URL or SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL in .env.development.local
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh backup neon ./backups
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh backup supabase ./backups
```

### Verify Cloudflare Downloads

If you downloaded the three files from Cloudflare R2 (`.dump.age`, `.sha256`, `.json`):

```bash
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh verify ./cloudflare-downloads
```

Example output:

```
[INFO] Verifying Cloudflare R2 downloaded files in: ./cloudflare-downloads
[INFO] Found files:
  Dump: ./cloudflare-downloads/wine-words_postgresql_neon_20240115T020000Z.dump.age
  Checksum: ./cloudflare-downloads/wine-words_postgresql_neon_20240115T020000Z.dump.age.sha256
  Metadata: ./cloudflare-downloads/wine-words_postgresql_neon_20240115T020000Z.dump.age.json
[INFO] Verifying SHA-256 checksum...
[SUCCESS] Checksum MATCHES
[INFO] Backup metadata:
{
  "system": "wine-words",
  "provider": "neon",
  "timestamp": "20240115T020000Z",
  "database": "wine_words_production",
  ...
}
[INFO] Testing decryption (requires BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_IDENTITY)...
[SUCCESS] Decryption test PASSED
[SUCCESS] All Cloudflare download files verified!
```

### Restore to Local Database

```bash
# From a verified Cloudflare download
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh restore neon ./cloudflare-downloads/backup.dump.age local
```

Interactive confirmation required:

```
[INFO] Target database: wine_words_development
[WARN] This will OVERWRITE the target database. Continue? (y/N)
```

### Restore to Neon Test Database

```bash
# Direct connection URL (must be a disposable/test database)
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh restore neon backup.dump.age neon "postgresql://user:pass@ep-xxx.neon.tech/test_db"
```

### List R2 Backups

```bash
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh list neon
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh list supabase
```

### Download Latest Backup from R2

```bash
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh download neon latest ./downloads
```

### Download Specific Backup from R2

```bash
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh download neon "wine-words/postgresql/neon/DAILY_20240115T020000Z.dump.age" ./downloads
```

## Complete Recovery Workflow (Cloudflare → Local)

```bash
# 1. Set up environment
export BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_IDENTITY=AGE-SECRET-KEY-...
export R2_BUCKET=database-backups
export R2_ENDPOINT=https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
export R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...

# 2. Download latest backup
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh download neon latest ./recovery

# 3. Verify files
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh verify ./recovery

# 4. Restore to local database
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh restore neon ./recovery/*.dump.age local
```

## Safety Features

- ✅ **Production protection** - Refuses to restore to databases with "prod" or "production" in name
- ✅ **Explicit confirmation** - Requires `y/N` before overwriting target
- ✅ **Checksum verification** - Validates SHA-256 before restore
- ✅ **Secure cleanup** - Shreds plaintext dump after restore
- ✅ **Schema validation** - Checks tables, migrations, and users post-restore

## Compatibility with GitHub Actions

This script uses the same format as the automated workflows:

- **Encryption**: age with key ID `v1`
- **Checksum**: SHA-256
- **Metadata**: JSON sidecar with schema info
- **R2 path**: `wine-words/postgresql/<provider>/DAILY_<timestamp>.dump.age`
- **pg_dump flags**: `--no-owner --no-acl --format=custom`

## Troubleshooting

| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pg_dump: command not found`                       | Install PostgreSQL 18 client: `brew install postgresql@18`                                 |
| `age: command not found`                           | Install age: `brew install age`                                                            |
| `CHECKSUM MISMATCH`                                | Re-download files; don't rename browser-added suffixes like `(1)`                          |
| `Decryption test FAILED`                           | Wrong private key; ensure `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_IDENTITY` matches the key used for encryption |
| `SAFETY: Target database appears to be production` | Use a disposable database name without "prod"/"production"                                 |
| `Connection fails / pooler rejected`               | Use direct host URL, not pooler; check TLS, firewall, credentials                          |

### Restore error: unrecognized `transaction_timeout`

Selecting PostgreSQL 18 clients does not upgrade the running local server.
A PostgreSQL 18 restore into PostgreSQL 14 can fail on `SET transaction_timeout`.
Use a PostgreSQL 18 or newer target server for these backups. The script now checks
its version before requesting overwrite confirmation and restores in one transaction
with error stopping, so SQL failures roll back rather than leave a partial restore.

Check the running server with `psql postgresql:///wine_words_development -Atc
'SHOW server_version;'` (as one shell command). If running a separate PostgreSQL 18
instance on another port, create the target database there and pass its URL as the
final restore argument, for example:

```bash
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh restore neon ./backups/BACKUP.dump.age local postgresql://localhost:5433/wine_words_development
```

The port above is an example; confirm the target server and port before restoring.
Earlier script versions continued after SQL errors; inspect an already attempted
restore before assuming it left the target unchanged.

### Small backups and restore validation

Restore compares the number of table definitions in the archive with the target's
user-table count; there is no five-table minimum. This is a count sanity check,
not a row-by-row integrity check. Successful transactional `pg_restore` is the
primary restore check. Missing Rails tables are reported as unavailable instead
of reporting fabricated zero row counts. Extra target tables produce a warning:
`--clean` only replaces objects present in the archive.

The source-provider argument labels the backup; it does not fetch data from that
provider. Restoring a `_local_` file with `restore neon` still restores that local
file. Use the intended Neon backup if you need the Neon database contents.

## Copy directly between configured databases

Run from the API root:

```bash
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh restore_local_to_neondb
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh restore_local_to_supabase
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh restore_local_to_local
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh restore_neondb_to_neondb
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh restore_neondb_to_local
```

| Command                     | Source variable      | Destination variable        |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `restore_local_to_neondb`   | `LOCAL_DATABASE_URL` | `NEON_DATABASE_URL`         |
| `restore_local_to_supabase` | `LOCAL_DATABASE_URL` | `SUPA_DATABASE_URL`         |
| `restore_local_to_local`    | `LOCAL_DATABASE_URL` | `LOCAL_SECOND_DATABASE_URL` |
| `restore_neondb_to_neondb`  | `NEON_DATABASE_URL`  | `NEON_SECOND_DATABASE_URL`  |
| `restore_neondb_to_local`   | `NEON_DATABASE_URL`  | `LOCAL_DATABASE_URL`        |

Set these URLs in `.env.development.local`; exported values take precedence.
`SUPA_DATABASE_URL` is the exact name used by the new shortcut. Existing
`backup supabase` and `restore ... supabase` commands still use
`SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL`.

Each command checks the destination version, creates a source backup in a unique
subdirectory of `./backups`, verifies it, and asks for overwrite confirmation
before restoring. Supply an optional output directory, for example:

```bash
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh restore_neondb_to_local ./scripts/backups
```

Backups are retained even if you cancel the restore. If encryption is configured,
both `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_RECIPIENT` and a matching `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_IDENTITY` are
needed. Without a recipient the retained backup is plaintext. No R2 upload or
download is involved. The source is not modified. The destination must already
exist, meet the PostgreSQL version requirement, and allow the restore operations.
Existing production-name checks and transactional restore behavior still apply.
Objects present in the backup are replaced; unrelated destination objects remain.
These commands do not create a separate backup of the destination.

## Copy directly from R2 to local

Run from the API root to download, verify, and restore a specific snapshot to
`LOCAL_DATABASE_URL`:

```bash
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh restore_r2_to_local "wine-words/postgresql/neon/DAILY_20240115T020000Z.dump.age"
```

Set the default in `.env.development.local`:

```dotenv
R2_BACKUP_SPECIFIC=latest
```

An omitted or empty first argument uses `R2_BACKUP_SPECIFIC`. Exported values take
precedence. `latest` selects the most recently modified `.dump.age` object under
`wine-words/postgresql/neon/`. A full object key selects that exact snapshot.

```bash
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh restore_r2_to_local
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh restore_r2_to_local "" ./downloads
```

Configure the R2 credentials listed above, `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_IDENTITY`, and
`LOCAL_DATABASE_URL`. Downloads and sidecars are retained in a unique directory
under `./backups` (or the optional second argument). Checksum, metadata, and
decryption verification run before the existing overwrite confirmation prompt.
The destination must already exist and meet the PostgreSQL version requirement.
Production-name checks and transactional restore behavior apply. Objects in the
backup replace matching destination objects; unrelated objects remain. This
command does not back up the destination.

### R2 listing returns AccessDenied

`latest` requires `ListObjectsV2` access. This error means listing failed, not
that the bucket has no backups. Check that the R2 S3 credentials have **Object
Read only** (or **Object Read & Write**) access to the bucket in `R2_BUCKET`,
and that `R2_ENDPOINT` belongs to the same account. See
[Cloudflare R2 authentication](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/tokens/).
Exported R2 variables override `.env.development.local`; check for stale shell
settings if you changed the file.

A full `.dump.age` object key, supplied as the first argument or as
`R2_BACKUP_SPECIFIC`, skips listing. Download access to the dump and its sidecars
is still required. After correcting access, retry the read-only listing with:

```bash
./scripts/db_backup_restore.sh list neon
```
